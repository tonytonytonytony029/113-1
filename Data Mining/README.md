# **Data Mining - Fall 2024**
This repository contains coursework from the **Data Mining** course, covering **frequent itemset mining, predictive modeling, and advanced analytics**.

## **HW1: Frequent Itemset Mining (Apriori Algorithm)**
**Objective**: Implement the **Apriori algorithm** for mining frequent itemsets in large-scale transactional data.

**Key Implementations**:
- Processed and analyzed transaction data using **IBM Generator**.
- Developed an **Apriori-based frequent itemset mining pipeline**.
- Evaluated the impact of **support threshold variations** on discovered patterns.

## **HW2: Machine Learning for Predictive Modeling**
**Objective**: Train machine learning models to predict patient survival using structured medical data.

**Key Implementations**:
- Conducted **data preprocessing**: missing value handling, feature scaling, and class balancing.
- Trained **Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Network models**.
- Evaluated models using **5-Fold Cross-Validation** and metrics like **AUROC & Macro F1-Score**.

## **Project: Advanced Data Analytics & Feature Engineering**
ðŸ“‚ **[Project Details](project/README.md)**  
**Objective**: Develop a **data analytics pipeline** for feature selection and model optimization.

**Technologies Used**: Python (pandas, scikit-learn), Apriori, Random Forest, XGBoost, Feature Engineering
