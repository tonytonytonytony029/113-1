# **Computer Networks - Fall 2024**
This repository contains coursework from the **Computer Networks** course, focusing on **Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV)**.

## **HW1: Software-Defined Networking (SDN) & Mininet**
**Objective**: Implement OpenFlow-based SDN using **Mininet** and an SDN controller.

**Key Implementations**:
- Set up a **virtualized network topology** using Mininet.
- Configure **OpenFlow rules** to enforce network policies.
- Implement **access control** rules for different network nodes.

## **HW2: Network Function Virtualization (NFV) - Dual Path Routing**
**Objective**: Develop a **dual-path routing** Virtual Network Function (VNF).

**Key Implementations**:
- Designed and implemented a **shortest-path and disjoint-path routing algorithm**.
- Developed a **RESTful API** for SDN controller interaction.
- Conducted **performance evaluations** of network routing strategies.

**Technologies Used**: OpenFlow, Mininet, SDN Controllers (ONOS, Ryu), Python, RESTful API
